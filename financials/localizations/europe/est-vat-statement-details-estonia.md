# <a name="vat-statement-details-for-estonia"></a>VAT statement details for Estonia

This topic explains how to set up a VAT statement for legal entities in Estonia.

This topic includes country/region-specific information about the setup of the value-added tax (VAT) statement for legal entities in Estonia only. For more information about the setup of VAT statements, see [(EU) VAT reporting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/localizations/europe/eu-vat-reporting).

## <a name="set-up-sales-tax-authorities"></a>Set up sales tax authorities
To generate a VAT declaration in the correct format for the appropriate tax authority, you must set up the report layout for sales tax authorities. On the **Sales tax authorities** page, in the **Report layout** field, select **Estonian report layout**. Select the same sales tax authority for the sales tax settlement period that will be used for the sales tax codes.

## <a name="set-up-sales-tax-reporting-codes"></a>Set up sales tax reporting codes
Here is an example that shows how you can use sales tax reporting codes to generate VAT statements.

| Sales tax reporting code | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Line on the VAT return (KMD) |

## <a name="set-up-vat-declaration-tax-codes"></a>Set up VAT declaration tax codes
The VAT declaration tax codes are used to map sales tax codes to values that are required in the declaration (20, 9, 20erikord, or 9erikord). In addition, for every tax code, you can specify optional sales and purchase comment codes (01, 02, or 03 for sales, and 11 or 12 for purchases). To set up VAT declaration tax codes, on the **VAT declaration tax code** page, set the following fields.

| Field                    | Description                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sales tax code           | Select the sales tax code that is used for sales or purchase invoices.                        |
| VAT declaration tax code | Enter the code that will appear on the declaration.                                           |
| Special code             | Enter the comment code that will appear in the sales and purchase annexes of the declaration. |

## <a name="configure-the-electronic-reporting-model-and-format-for-the-report"></a>Configure the Electronic reporting model and format for the report
To review or change the VAT statement configuration, on the **Reporting configurations** page, select **VAT declaration model**. This same model is used for Austria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania, and for aggregate tax data that is required for the VAT declaration. Click **Designer** to review or change the model. To review or change the VAT statement format, on the **Reporting configurations** page, select **VAT declaration model**, and then click **Designer**.

## <a name="generate-a-vat-statement"></a>Generate a VAT statement
At the end of the VAT reporting period, the Settle and post sales tax process calculates statement line amounts for the definition of sales tax reporting codes that you created.

-   If the company must use the date of the VAT register instead of the tax transaction date, the **Date of Vat register** field on the **General ledger parameters** page must be selected.
-   **Estonian report layout** must be selected as the report layout of the sales tax authority that is configured for the settlement period.
-   If the **Conditional sales tax** field is selected on the **General ledger parameters** page, the Estonian VAT declaration will support the Cash accounting scheme, and the Sales and Purchase annexes must be completed.

To generate a VAT XML file, on the **Sales tax payments** page, select one or more vouchers, and then click **Export VAT XML file**. **Notes:**

-   You can select more than one sales tax payment line for each requested period.
-   If the selected lines occurred in more than one settlement period, you receive an error message.

Then set the following fields.
