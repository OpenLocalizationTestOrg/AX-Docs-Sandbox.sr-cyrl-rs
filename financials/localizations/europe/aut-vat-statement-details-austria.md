# <a name="vat-statement-details-for-austria"></a>VAT statement details for Austria

This topic explains how to set up the VAT statement for legal entities in Austria.

This topic includes country/region-specific information about the setup of the value-added tax (VAT) statement for legal entities in Austria only. For more information about the setup of the VAT statement, see [(EU) VAT reporting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/financials/localizations/europe/eu-vat-reporting). The rest of this topic shows how to set up sales tax codes and sales tax reporting codes for the Austrian VAT declaration, so that VAT statements can be generated.

## <a name="set-up-sales-tax-authorities"></a>Set up sales tax authorities
To generate a VAT declaration in the correct format for the appropriate tax authority, you must set up the report layout for the sales tax authorities. On the **Sales tax authorities** page, in the **Report layout** field, select **Austrian report layout**. Select the same sales tax authority for the sales tax settlement period that will be used in the sales tax codes.

## <a name="set-up-sales-tax-codes-and-sales-tax-reporting-codes-for-vat-reporting"></a>Set up sales tax codes and sales tax reporting codes for VAT reporting
Here is an example that shows how you might set up sales tax codes and sales tax reporting codes to generate a VAT statement.

**Note:** The preceding configuration is an example and depends on the structure of the sales tax codes that are used, as defined by the user. To have values calculated and transferred to the declaration, for each tax code that is used in the sales tax payment process, you must set a relevant sales tax reporting code in one or multiple fields on the **Report setup** tab.
