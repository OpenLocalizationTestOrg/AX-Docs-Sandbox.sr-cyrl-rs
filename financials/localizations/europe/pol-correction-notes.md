# <a name="pol-correction-notes"></a>(POL) Correction notes

This topic provides information about correction notes. A correction note is a document that is required by local regulations in Poland. It's used to correct errors on a vendor invoice. 

If a vendor issues a sales document to a company, but makes a mistake about the companyâ€™s address or value-added tax (VAT) identification number, local regulations in Poland require that the company issue a correction note to the vendor. A correction note contains both the original text and the corrected text. You can create, post, and print a correction note from the Correction notes journal. The following fields are available on the Correction notes journal.
