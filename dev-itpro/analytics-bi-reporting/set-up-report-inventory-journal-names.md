# <a name="inventory-journal-reports"></a>Inventory journal reports

When you use configurable inventory reports based on electronic reporting, you need to set up a relationship between a specific report and a journal type.

To set up a relationship between a specific report and a journal type, on the **Inventory journal names** page (**Inventory management** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Journal names** &gt; **Inventory**), enter a name for the report. **Note:** To set up supported configurations, download the required electronic reporting configurations. For more information, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/operations/dev-itpro/analytics-bi-reporting/download-electronic-reporting-er-configuration-from-lifecycle-services). Examples of inventory reports with supported configurations in Europe are listed in the following table.
